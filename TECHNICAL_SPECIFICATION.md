### Enhanced Data Structures

#### Function Repository (Expanded)
```python
FUNCTIONS = [
    (function_name, description, comprehensive_example),
    # Tuple structure: (str, str, str)
    # Enhanced with 6 core Python functions instead of 3
]
```

**Current Repository Contents**:
- `len()` - Object length calculation with multiple examples

- `type()` - Object type inspection for debugging
- `print()` - Console output with formatting options
- `input()` - User input handling with type conversion

#### Global State Management
```python
file_counter = 1        # Incremental counter for unique naming
used_names = set()      # Set to track used filenames and prevent duplicates
```

### Core Functions (Enhanced)

#### 1. `open_vscode_new_window()`
**Purpose**: Launch new VS Code window with enhanced reliability
**Technical Implementation**:
- **Primary Method**: Uses `subprocess.Popen()` with `--new-window` flag
- **Fallback Method**: Windows Run dialog (`Win+R`) for compatibility
- **Directory Setup**: Automatically creates `generated_files` directory
- **Cross-Platform**: Detects OS and uses appropriate launch method

**Process Flow**:
```
Directory Check → Subprocess Launch → Fallback (if needed) → Wait Period → Success Validation
```

**Enhanced Features**:
- Automatic directory creation via `ensure_generated_files_dir()`
- Better error handling with fallback mechanisms
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)

#### 2. `ensure_generated_files_dir()`
**Purpose**: Create and manage output directory structure
**Technical Implementation**:
- Creates `generated_files` subdirectory if it doesn't exist
- Uses `os.makedirs()` for recursive directory creation
- Provides user feedback about directory status
- Integrates with path management system

#### 3. `generate_unique_filename(func_name)`
**Purpose**: Generate collision-free filenames with tracking
**Parameters**:
- `func_name` (str): Python function name to base filename on

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Base Name Generation**: Sanitizes function names (removes `()`, spaces)
- **Incremental Numbering**: Uses 3-digit zero-padded counter (001, 002, etc.)
- **Collision Prevention**: Maintains `used_names` set for uniqueness
- **Path Generation**: Returns both filename and full path tuple

**Return Values**: `(filename, full_path)` tuple

**Naming Convention**:
```
{sanitized_function_name}_example_{counter:03d}.py
Example: len_example_001.py, str_example_002.py
```

#### 4. `write_function_improved(func_name, description, example)`
**Purpose**: Create and populate Python files with enhanced content
**Parameters**:

**Content Template**:
```python
# {func_name}: {description}
# Example:

{comprehensive_example}

# End of example
```

**Purpose**: Main execution loop with enhanced monitoring and control
**Technical Implementation**:
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks successful/failed file creation
- **Time Management**: Real-time remaining time calculation and display
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from individual failures
- **User Control**: Keyboard interrupt support and emergency stops
- **Statistics Tracking**: Detailed session reporting

**Enhanced Loop Features**:
- Progress indicators with success/failure counts
- Remaining time display
- Individual error isolation (one failure doesn't stop the bot)
- Longer inter-iteration delays (8 seconds) for system stability

## Configuration and Customization (Enhanced)

### Primary Configuration Options

#### Runtime and Performance
```python
TOTAL_RUNTIME_HOURS = 1     # Execution duration (hours)
pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.8       # Inter-operation delay (seconds)
```

#### VS Code Integration
```python

# Automatically manages output directory structure
```

### Extensibility Points

#### 1. Function Repository Expansion
```python
# Add new Python functions to demonstrate
FUNCTIONS.append((
    "max()",
    "Returns the largest item from an iterable or arguments.",
    "numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\nprint(f'Maximum: {max(numbers)}')  # Output: Maximum: 9"
))
```

#### 2. Content Template Customization
```python
# Modify the content structure in write_function_improved()
content = f"""
# {func_name}: {description}
# Created: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
# Generated by: CodeWeaverBot
# Category: Core Python Functions

{example}

# Additional Notes:
# - This example was generated automatically by CodeWeaverBot
# - For more information, see Python documentation
"""
```

#### 3. File Organization Patterns
```python
# Customize filename generation
def generate_unique_filename(func_name):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    return f"{base_name}_{timestamp}.py"
```

### Platform-Specific Adaptations

#### Windows Optimizations
- Uses Windows Run dialog as fallback
- Handles Windows-specific path formats
- Optimized for Windows keyboard shortcuts

#### Linux/macOS Support
