# Note: The following packages are part of Python's standard library
# and do not need to be installed separately:
# 
# - logging       (structured logging and error tracking)
# - pathlib       (modern path handling)
# - typing        (type hints for better code quality)
# - time          (timing and delays)
# - random        (random selection and number generation) 
# - subprocess    (process management for launching VS Code)
# - os            (operating system interface and file operations)
# - sys           (system-specific parameters and functions)
# - datetime      (date and time calculations)

# Platform-specific notes:
# 
# Windows:
# - No additional dependencies required
# - Ensure Visual Studio Code is installed and accessible via 'code' command
# 
# Linux:
# - May require: sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
# - For PyAutoGUI screen capture: sudo apt-get install scrot
# - For PyAutoGUI GUI automation: sudo apt-get install python3-xlib
# 
# macOS:
# - May require PyObjC for full PyAutoGUI functionality
# - Install with: pip install pyobjc-core pyobjc
# 
# Installation command for CodeWeaverBot:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
